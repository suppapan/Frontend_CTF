Quick start
The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/suppapan/Frontend_CTF.git`

`cd Frontend_CTF`

`npm install`

`npm start`

Note: There's an issue in ganache-core that can make the npm install step fail.

If you see npm ERR! code ENOLOCAL, try running npm ci instead of npm install.

Open http://localhost:3000/ to see your Dapp. You will need to have Metamask installed and listening to localhost 8545.
